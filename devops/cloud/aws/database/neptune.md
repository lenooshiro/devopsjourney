# Amazon Netptune

## Introduction

Amazon Neptune is a fast, reliable, secure, and fully managed graph database service.

Graph databases are used to store and navigate through relationships between connected data that could contain billions of separate relationships.

It's ideal to identify these relationships of interconnected data rather than the data itself.

## Example Scenarios

Whenever you're navigating through a website or a social network, you'll often receive recommendations of produts that might interest you.

Those recommendation engines are widely used by websites to recommend products based on your search and purchase history or interactions with a determined ad or post.

Graph databases such as Neptune allows you to perform complex queries based on differenct activities and operations made by the user to help determine recommendations of what your customer might like to purchase next.

## Query Languages

Amazon Neptune uses its own graph database engine and supports two graph query frameworks:
- Apache Tinkerpop Gremlin
- World Wide Web Consortium SparQL
