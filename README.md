I'm going to use this repository to document my journey as a Devops Engineer.
Although I've been working as one for some years already, I feel that there's a lot of room to improve. I hope that this repository will not only help me with my studies, to get a better understandings of the fundamentals, but will also help many others who are following the same path.

The original idea is from [90DaysOfDevOps](https://github.com/MichaelCade/90DaysOfDevOps).
