I'm using this repository to document my journey as a Devops Engineer.

Although I've been working as one for some years already, I feel that there's a lot of room to improve. I understand that this repository is a bit confusing but I'm still reorganizing it.

I'm prioritizing topics that's I'm still learning, such as cloud providers. Lots of topics are ones that I already know, but I need time to write down everything.

I hope that this repository will not only help me with my studies, to get a better understandings of the fundamentals, but will also help many others who are following the same path.
