# Virtual Cloud Network (VPC)

## Introduction

Amazon VPC is a cloud computing service that offers a virtual private cloud, providing a logically isolated section of AWS Cloud.

During the VPC creation, the only one who have access to it is the creator's account and no one else. There's also millions of others customers VPCs within AWS Network, but they are all isolated in a way that they can't have access to your network, nor you have access to theirs.

## What is a VPC used for?

You use a VPC to deploy your resources within it, such as compute resources, storage or databases, in a safe and secure manner. This way you can start deploying your solution within the cloud.

It's worth noting that, by default, you are allowed only up to five VPCs per region per AWS account.
