# Microsoft Azure Function

## Introduction

Azure Functions is similar to App Service, except that it executes a single individual function instead of an entire application, and you only pay when it gets used.

When you provision and App Service instance, it runs until you shut it down and you pay for the whole time it's running. It1's possible to configure Functions to behave the same way, but it's usually better to use the Consumption plan, which means that it only uses resources when a function is running, so you only pay when a function is running.
